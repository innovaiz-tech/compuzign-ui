## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// Icons for 6R strategies and features
import Button from '../components/common/button';
import useWindowSize from '../hooks/useWindowSize';
import ScrollToTop from '../components/ui/ScrollToTop';
```

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: #FACC15 (amber/yellow)
- **Backgrounds**: Gradients from amber/yellow to transparent
- **Dark Sections**: Black to gray gradients
- **Text**: White on dark, gray-900 on light
- **Accents**: Blue and purple gradients for variety

### Animation Strategy
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth page transitions and scroll animations
- **Hover Effects**: Card lift effects, button interactions
- **Progress Indicators**: Animated timeline and process steps
- **Planet Orbit**: Rotating icons around central hub (NO connecting lines)

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Vertical layouts, stacked sections
- **Tablet**: Adjusted grid systems, readable typography
- **Desktop**: Full template layouts with proper spacing
- **xl screens**: 4-column grid for platform cards

## Content Integration

### 6R Strategies (Exact Content)
1. **ðŸŸ¢ Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)**: Move with little/no modification
2. **ðŸ”µ Replatform (Lift-tinker-and-shift)**: Minor optimizations 
3. **ðŸŸ  Refactor/Rearchitect**: Rebuild for cloud-native
4. **ðŸŸ£ Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**: Replace with SaaS
5. **ðŸ”´ Retire**: Decommission obsolete applications
6. **ðŸŸ¡ Retain (Revisit)**: Keep on-premises for now

### Strategy Selection Chart

Cloud Migration

AWS, Azure and GCP Services

===========================

CompuZign Cloud Migration breaks out the 6 Cloud Migration Strategies (6 R's)



1. ðŸŸ¢ Rehost (Lift-and-Shift)



Description: Move applications to the cloud with little or no modification.

* Use When: You need to migrate quickly or temporarily.

* Pros: Fast, low risk, minimal change.

* Cons: Doesn't take full advantage of cloud-native features.



Example: Migrating a VM from on-prem VMware to AWS EC2 or Azure VM.



2. ðŸ”µ Replatform (Lift-tinker-and-shift)



Description: Move to the cloud with minor optimizationsâ€”no major code changes.

* Use When: You want modest improvements (e.g., cost or performance) during migration.

* Pros: Improves efficiency; moderate time investment.

* Cons: Still not fully cloud-native.



Example: Moving an app to AWS and switching the database from self-managed MySQL to Amazon RDS.



3. ðŸŸ  Refactor / Rearchitect



Description: Rebuild or redesign the app to leverage cloud-native capabilities.

* Use When: You want to improve scalability, agility, or resilience.

* Pros: Fully optimized for cloud.

* Cons: Time-consuming, higher cost, complex.



Example: Breaking a monolithic app into microservices and deploying it on Kubernetes in GCP or AWS.



4. ðŸŸ£ Repurchase (Drop and Shop)

Description: Abandon the legacy application and replace it with a SaaS product.



*Use When: A SaaS offering can meet your business needs more effectively.

*Pros: Fast, cost-effective, low maintenance.

*Cons: Loss of customization; possible retraining.



Example: Replacing a legacy CRM with Salesforce or an internal HR system with Workday.



5. ðŸ”´ Retire

Description: Decommission or archive applications that are no longer useful.



* Use When: Legacy apps are obsolete or duplicated elsewhere.

* Pros: Reduces cost and complexity.

* Cons: Requires thorough analysis and stakeholder buy-in.



Example: Shutting down an old reporting tool no longer used after Power BI is adopted.



6. ðŸŸ¡ Retain (Revisit)

Description: Keep some applications on-premises due to technical, regulatory, or business reasons.



* Use When: Migration isn't feasible or justified now.

* Pros: Avoids unnecessary cost.

* Cons: Adds hybrid complexity.



Example: Keeping a latency-sensitive legacy system on-premises while moving others to Azure, GCP or AWS.
